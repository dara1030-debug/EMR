## Collaborative Development utilizing Git

<dl>
  <p>We are constantly writing code and make changes and so on. And this repository is our single code base. We will be using Git a lot during development, so here are my instructions for using Git for our collaborative development for the EMR System.</p>
  <dt>I have implemented several features for the system. How do I push this to the main repository?</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Stage the changes and commit it along with a relevant commit message.</p>
      <div>Stage the changes by executing the command below.</div>
      <code>git add .</code>
      <div>Commit it with a relevant commit message. (e.g. implemented User create form)</div>
      <code>git commit -m 'I have implemented something'</code>
      <div>After committing changes, simply push those changes into the repository</div>
      <code>git push</code>
  </dd>
</dl>
